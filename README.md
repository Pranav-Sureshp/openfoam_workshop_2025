1. Turbulence cases
   - periodic channel flow
   - Vortex shedding from flow past a cylinder 
2. MHD cases
   - MHD 2D channel flow (Hartmann MHD channel flow)
   - Shercliff flow (MHD flow in insulating duct) in a duct (at Ha=20)
   - Custom solvers :
     - mhdEpotFoam - Shercliff flow (MHD flow in insulating duct) at Ha=20
     - mhdEpotMultiRegionFoam - Hunt flow (MHD flow in a duct with insulating side walls and conducting Hartmann walls)
